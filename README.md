# Multi-Package Manager CLI (mg)

mg is a cross-ecosystem package management tool that supports multiple package managers (such as **cargo**, **npm**, **pnpm**, **yarn**, **pip**, **pdm**, and **poetry**),
providing a unified command-line interface.
By automatically detecting project types, **mg** intelligently invokes the corresponding package manager, simplifying package management operations in cross-language development.

## Features

- **Cross-ecosystem support**: Supports package managers for ecosystems like **Rust**, **Node.js**, and **Python**.
- **Automatic project type detection**: Automatically selects the package manager based on project files (e.g., **Cargo.toml**, **package.json**, **pyproject.toml**, etc.).
- **Unified command interface**: Provides unified commands such as **add**, **remove**, **upgrade**, and **analyze**.
- **Dynamic parameter support**: Allows passing arbitrary package manager parameters and supports native command formats.
- **Colored output**: Uses colored terminal output to enhance readability.

## Dynamic Parameter Support

mg supports passing arbitrary package manager parameters, and all parameters are directly passed to the underlying package manager.

```bash
# Cargo
mg add serde -F derive --no-default-features
# Equivalent to: cargo add serde --features derive --no-default-features

# npm
mg add react --legacy-peer-deps
# Equivalent to: npm install react --legacy-peer-deps

# Poetry
mg add pytest -G dev --extras coverage
# Equivalent to: poetry add pytest --group dev --extras coverage
```

## Colored Output

mg uses colored terminal output to enhance readability:

- **Package manager name**: Cyan
- **Executed command**: Yellow
- **Success message**: Green
- **Dependency analysis title**: Cyan

```bash
$ mg add serde
Using cargo package manager
Executing: cargo add serde
âœ“ Packages added successfully
```
